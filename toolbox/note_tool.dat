----------------------------------------

misc folders:

* lc3_docs   = apendix a, b, and c from the book
* src_code   = all of the bin, asm, and c examples from McGraw Hill source
* tools      = sources of lc3 related tools

----------------------------------------

* on installing an assembler:

this is probably going to be not the easiest install.
preferably i use the simpl assembler.
it seems like the different formats of assembly used by the tools might be incompatible
never have tried to get simpl to run on ubuntu yet.

basically simpl is an emulator/interpreter that takes in assembly code.
the file is never actually processed into machine code on disk.
also there isnt really an official way to link file with simpl.
files can be linked if run the command with multiple args,
however the addresses need to be hard set in the files themselves manually.

* on the lc3tools and lcc:

so far haven't been able to get the lc3tools to properly work with my old asm code.
i think the mcgrawhill stuff doesn't take some of the stuff simpl lets you do.

the goal is to have both things working so that the code an be tested and debugged interactively before assembly/compilation
the idea is to work with the examples form the book and website as much as possible and to assume that all of the input and those sources are well formed.
that way even if never able to get any of the actual assembler/complier tools to work, there is still binary, assembly, and c code to work with
