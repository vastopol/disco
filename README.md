disassembler/decompiler

LC-3 An educational assembly programming language from Patt and Patel's Introduction to Computing Systems.
Some of the executables in LC-3 folders were taken out of a customized CentOS image used to teach CS61 at UCR.
this repo is now the home of my LC-3 projects

The idea for this project is to first start with a simple prototype application for the LC-3 then build a final version for ARM assembly.
the LC-3 is a good base since it is simple but functional and i am already familiar with it from school classes.

it would be interesting to have an assembler and a disassembler, then maybe a small compiler and decompiler.

the disassembler will probably be written in python. most likely simple since LC-3 isn't too complex.
it would also be nice to figure out how to use the other LC-3 tools from the book and other sources.

this is interesting to understand the internals of compilers, assemblers, linkers, and loaders.
