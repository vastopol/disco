# disco
this repo is now the home of my LC-3 assembly projects and the disassembler/decompiler project
the asm source code is for the LC-3 assembly programming language from Patt and Patel's Introduction to Computing Systems.

* dis  = disassembler/decompiler project
* LC-3 = assembly code projects (mainly for simpl)
* misc = notes, source, tools

The disassembler/decompiler project idea is to start with a prototype application for the LC-3 then build a final version for ARM eventually.
it would be interesting to have an assembler and a disassembler, then maybe a small c compiler and decompiler.
this is interesting to understand the internals of compilers, assemblers, linkers, and loaders.
