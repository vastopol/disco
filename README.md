# disco

The only customized disassembly framework for the LC-3 architecture.

This project targets the LC-3 assembly programming language from Patt and Patel's Introduction to Computing Systems.

## The Disassembler

`disco` is a linear sweep disassembler and toolchain for the LC-3 assembly language

currently working on completing a functioning disassembler before starting the decompiler.

disassembler prototype 1 complete

`disco` is integrated with the `lc3tools` and `lcc-1.3` C language compiler.

## The Project

LC-3 assembly coding projects and the LC-3 disassembler/decompiler project

* dis       = disassembler/decompiler project
* LC-3      = assembly code projects (written for simpl assembler)
* toolbox   = notes, source, tools
