disassembler/decompiler

LC-3 An educational assembly programming language from Patt and Patel's Introduction to Computing Systems
the material contained in the MIPS and LC-3 folders was taken out of a customized CentOS image used to teach CS61 at UCR

the idea is to first start with a simple prototype application for the LC-3 then build a final version with ARM assembly

the disassembler will probably be written in python. most likely simple since LC-3 isn't too complex.
it would also be nice to figure out how to use the other LC-3 tools from the book and other sources.
