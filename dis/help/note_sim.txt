Simulators for LC-3

there are 3 simulators

the goal is to have things working so that the code an be tested and debugged interactively before assembly/compilation


* lc3tools and lcc: NOTE

it seems like the different formats of assembly used by the tools might be incompatible
i think the mcgrawhill stuff doesn't take some of the stuff simpl lets you do.
so far haven't been able to get the lc3tools to properly work with my old asm code.
also dont know yet how to compile stuff with lcc


lc3sim vs simpl vs PennSim

* lc3sim

this simulator runs on command line.
takes object files produced by either the assembler or converter


* simpl

can use the command line or gui
basically simpl is an emulator/interpreter that takes in assembly code.
the file is never actually processed into machine code on disk.
also there isnt really an official way to link file with simpl.
files can be linked if run the command with multiple args,
however the addresses need to be hard set in the files themselves manually.


* PennSim

can use the command line or gui
has integrated assembler and loader,
basically need to write a link and load script to bootstrap the simulator.
It will then assemble and load the lc3 object files

defaults to lc3 in gui mode

Usage: java PennSim [-lc3] [-p37x] [-pipeline] [-t] [-s script]
  -lc3 : simulate the LC-3 ISA
  -p37x : simulate the P37X ISA
  -pipeline : simulate a 5-stage fully-bypassed pipeline
  -t : start in command-line mode
  -s script : run 'script' from a script file
