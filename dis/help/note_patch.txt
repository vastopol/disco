when patch should be applied steps:
disassemble the original file
resymbolize
remove the last line .END
append code patch
change first lines of code to detour launch
probably have to count size of launch stub,
so can redirect back to original program by address

launch patches with a JSR to label

would be nice to have multiple patch methods
1. single front detour stub in front, code patches in rear
2. full front load code patches and redirect upfront
3. append patch to rear, then find and replace other JSR labels to jump to this patch

should have ability to apply multiple patches
have an array of object which represent patches
apply each patch in order
patches can be of different types

each patch has 4 parts:
header + code + return + local data
