Program Descriptions
--------------------

prgm/
    * bin_manip.asm
        Takes strings of binary from user and performs bitwise operations on them

prgm/small/
    * array_rev.asm
        Takes in upto 16 chars from user, saves to array, physically reverses the array content, then prints
    
    * fib.asm
        Calculate the nth fibonacci number iteratively
    
    * multiply.asm
        Demonstrates multiplication by repetitive addition
    
    * not.asm
        Demonstrates 2's complement
    
    * print_rev.asm
        Takes in upto 16 chars from user, saves to array, then prints array in reverse order


============================================================================

Also:

The program "bin_manip.asm" requires the libraries "lib_bitwise.asm" and "lib_io.asm"
