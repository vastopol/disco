The file "stack.asm" is an implementation of the operations PUSH and POP for a stack.

The file "calc.asm" uses modified versions of the PUSH and POP algorithms, and other subroutines to make an RPN calculator.

There still are some problems with the RPN calculator
- supposed to be from x3FFF to x3FFB, however it looks off...
- stack it can only hold 3 vals
- If an error like add with only one operand on stack, it will lose the operand, stack will be reset
