*** IMPORTANT ***
- These libraries are probably not portable to different assemblers.
- They are presented as is (may contain defects, etc...)
- Don't expect any values to be preserved in their registers
- Currently most of the routines don't backup anything except the return address
- Don't expect error checking
- etc

- also the input capture routines most likely append the newline... (probably fix later if need)
